Description
  The force model performs the calculation of forces (e.g. fluid-particle
  interaction forces) acting on each DEM particle. The ShirgaonkarIB model
  calculates the drag force (viscous and pressure force) acting on each
  particle in a resolved manner (see Shirgaonkar et al. (2009): “A new
  mathematical formulation and fast algorithm for fully resolved simulation
  of self-propulsion”, Journal of Comp. Physics). This model is only suited
  for resolved CFD-DEM simulations where the particle is represented by
  immersed boundary method.

Syntax
  forceModels
  (
    ShirgaonkarIB
  );
  ShirgaonkarIBProps
  {
    verbose true;
    treatForceExplicit true;
  };

Restrictions
  Only for immersed boundary solvers.
