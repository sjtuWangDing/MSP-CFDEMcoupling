Description
  The locateModel “engineIB” locates the CFD cell and cellID corresponding
  to a given position. This locate model is especially designed for parallel
  immersed boundary method. Each particle is represented by “satellite points”
  if it is distributed over several processors.

  The engineSearchIB locate Model can be used with different settings to
  use different algorithms:
  - treeSearch false; will execute some geometric (linear) search using the
    last known cellID (recommended)
  - treeSearch true; will use a recursive tree structure to find the cell.

  This model is a modification of the engine search model. Instead of using
  the centre-cell as starting point for the engine search, further satellite
  points located on the surface of the sphere are checked. This ensures that
  (parts of) spheres can be located even when their centre is on another
  processor. This is especially important for parallel computations, when a
  sphere is about to move from one processor to another.

Syntax
  locateModel engineIB;
  engineIBProps
  {
    treeSearch switch1;
    zSplit value1;
    xySplit value2;
  }

Restrictions
  Only for immersed boundary solvers.
